# John the Ripper

### Explanation
Password cracking tool used in cybersecurity to find weak passwords by attempting various attacks on password hashes. It supports multiple algorithms, including Unix crypt, MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256, and offers customizable attack modes such as dictionary, brute-force, and hybrid attacks. With features like wordlist generation and performance optimization, it efficiently tests password strength across different platforms. However, it should be used responsibly and ethically in authorized security assessments.

### Dictionary Attack
```john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt```  
The command you provided is an example of using John the Ripper to crack passwords stored in the file "hash.txt" using the "rockyou.txt" wordlist located in the directory *"/usr/share/wordlists/"*.  

- **john**: This is the command to invoke John the Ripper.

- **--wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt**: This option specifies the wordlist file to be used for the dictionary attack. In this case, it's set to "rockyou.txt", a popular and extensive wordlist often used for password cracking.
- **hash.txt**: This is the file containing the password hashes that you want to crack. Replace "hash.txt" with the actual filename/path where your password hashes are stored.

### Brute-Force Attack
```john --incremental hash.txt```  
This command tells John to perform a brute-force attack by trying all possible combinations of characters against the password hashes stored in "hash.txt".

### Hybrid Attack (Combining Dictionary and Brute-Force)
```john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --rules --incremental hash.txt```  
This command tells John to perform a hybrid attack using the wordlist "passwords.txt", applying custom rules to modify dictionary words, and trying all possible combinations of characters against the password hashes stored in "hash.txt".

#### OUTPUT Example
```
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (bcrypt [Blowfish 32/64 X3])
Cost 1 (iteration count) is 4096 for all loaded hashes
Will run 2 OpenMP threads
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
spongebob1       (?)     
1g 0:00:01:11 DONE (2024-03-11 11:22) 0.01397g/s 18.86p/s 18.86c/s 18.86C/s crazy1..eunice
Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed.
```
In this case the password was **spongebob1**.
