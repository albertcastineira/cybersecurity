# Shell Stabilization

### Explanation
Shell stabilization refers to the process of ensuring that a shell session, particularly one obtained through a reverse shell or other means of remote access, remains active, reliable, and fully functional. This is crucial for maintaining access to a compromised system over an extended period or in situations where network conditions may be unstable. Stabilizing a shell involves various techniques and methods to enhance its functionality and resilience.

### Prerequisite
Target machine must have ***Python 2 or 3 installed***

### Stabilize your shell
- 1: Import pty module and spawn bash shell:
```python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'```
<br/>
- 2: Press *CTRL + Z* to background process and get back to your host machine
<br/>
- 3: Use stty command to set terminal line settings and foreground back the target terminal:
```stty raw -echo; fg```
<br/>
- 4: Set the terminal emulator to xterm:
```export TERM=xterm```  
<br/>
- 5: Press Enter
